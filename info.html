                        <p>German Simulations Pvt. Ltd. is a Mumbai-based company committed to the vision of spreading the use of business simulations in India.</p>
                            <br>
                        <p> We would like to explain the choice of the two words German and Simulations that we use in the name of the company.</p> 
                            <br>
                           <p>The first thoughts that immediately come to your mind when you hear the word "German" and "Germany" are high quality and high performance. Over time, German technology and practices have proven its mettle in the understanding of economy and business. German firms and its practices have stood the test over varying situations and conditions, delivering consistently optimal results. Thus, it only seems fitting to have simulation based on those conceptual understanding to provide an effective and efficient experience. German Simulations Pvt. Ltd. serves to be your link for it.</p> 
                            <br>
                           <p>Simulations are one of the newest tools for teaching, largely made possible by recent developments in information and communication technologies. It emerged out of the need to fulfil the growing gap between the conceptually driven academic learning and the hands-on skills required in the industry.</p> 
                            <br>
                          <p>Fundamentally, business simulation systems provide a virtual environment that mimics certain scenarios in the real world. It is very similar to what a manager would encounter when he looks at the dashboard or management reports. In a real world, a manager would make decisions based on these information and his conceptual understanding. This is what exactly the simulation environment provides for. The users make decisions and enter them into the silumation. Based on these inputs the simulation systems gives an picture of how would the decisions affect the company in real world.</p>  
                            <br>
                           <p>Such a situation analysis - decision making cycle is usually run several times, and the time-series effect can be understood. Thus, a user gets a chance to put the classroom concepts to practice and have a simulated experience of workings in an actual industry.</p> 
                            <br>
                         <p>    German Simulations Pvt. Ltd. has signed an exclusive contract to market, sell and support in India the leading business simulation in Germany, iBizSim: International Business Simulations</p>

        <div class="container-content">
            <p>iBizSim is an acronym for International Business Simulations. iBizSim is a teaching tool that faculty members of business schools can use in the areas of Marketing, Logistics, Operations, Finance, International Business, and/or Strategy and Planning.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It covers several aspects of an internationally run business from a management standpoint. It is usually used in an integrative, capstone business course, in which the company is depicted as a complex, integrated whole, comprised of the different divisions and departments working together in well-defined ways. Participants get a chance to explore the concepts of the core domains of managing a manufacturing company and integrate the analysis with company strategy.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Teams of participants are given the responsibility to manage a simulated company. They learn to define goals and strategies, to implement plans and to develop controlling systems to evaluate the performance of the simulated company they are managing. Often, the intensity of action is also a close approximation of workload likely to be faced by such professionals.</p>
