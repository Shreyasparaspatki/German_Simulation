                    iBizSim is an acronym for International Business Simulations. iBizSim is a teaching tool that faculty members of business schools can use in the areas of Marketing, Logistics, Operations, Finance, International Business, and/or Strategy and Planning.
                    It covers several aspects of an internationally run business from a management standpoint. It is usually used in an integrative, capstone business course, in which the company is depicted as a complex, integrated whole, comprised of the different divisions and departments working together in well-defined ways. Participants get a chance to explore the concepts of the core domains of managing a manufacturing company and integrate the analysis with company strategy.
                    Teams of participants are given the responsibility to manage a simulated company. They learn to define goals and strategies, to implement plans and to develop controlling systems to evaluate the performance of the simulated company they are managing. Often, the intensity of action is also a close approximation of workload likely to be faced by such professionals.
